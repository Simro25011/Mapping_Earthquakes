# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview of the project

The purpose of this project is to provide a visual representation of the difference between the magnitudes of earthquakes around the world over the past 7 days. We wrote a script to fetch GeoJSON seismic data from the USGS website and get the geographic coordinates and magnitudes of earthquakes for the last 7 days. Then add the data to the map. Because the information is linked to a live feed, the map is updated whenever the user accesses the map. A script was created using JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitude of an earthquake from GeoJSON data. We then used the Leaflet library to draw data on a Mapbox style map through API requests and made it interactive by adding visualizations for different map styles and creating layers to display tectonic plates, earthquake magnitudes, and location information to display .
